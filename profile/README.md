# 8-Magic

**A clairvoyant piece of project — mystical answers via API, CLI, and Node.**

Welcome to **8-Magic**, a family of tools inspired by the classic [*Magic 8-Ball*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_8_Ball) ✨.  
Ask your question, and let the code whisper back an answer — sometimes cryptic, sometimes obvious, always a little bit magical.

## 🔮 What is this?

8-Magic is a collection of projects that deliver **mystical answers** in different forms:

- **[8-magic](https://github.com/8-Magic/8-magic)** – The core application  
- **[8-magic-api](https://github.com/8-Magic/8-magic-api)** – A clairvoyant piece of API  
- **[8-magic-cli](https://github.com/8-Magic/8-magic-cli)** – A clairvoyant piece of cURL  
- **[8-magic-npx](https://github.com/8-Magic/8-magic-npx)** – A clairvoyant Node package for CLI  
- **[8-Magic-Public-License](https://github.com/8-Magic/8-Magic-Public-License)** – Our custom license, inspired by CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

## ✨ Why?

Because sometimes developers don’t just want deterministic results — they want a bit of **mystery** in their workflow.  
8-Magic brings playful unpredictability to your terminal, API calls, and apps.

- **API**: make a request and receive an answer from the void  
- **CLI**: summon answers directly in your terminal  
- **npx package**: run it instantly, no install needed
